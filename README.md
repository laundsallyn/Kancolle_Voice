# Kancolle_Voice
This is a fan based android app I made in Summer, 2016. I transported part of the voice system of KanColle (a popular web game) in to a mobil app.
It runs in background and provides hourly vocal message and idle message.
Mainly employed Android Service, Ascyntask and Alarm Manager libraries.
It's a fun project, tested out by a few of my friend and will not be published due to copyright issue (secondary creation).
